# Virtual Acoustics: Revisiting the Jedi Chamber
Investigating further methods to model the famous Jedi Chamber 3 years later.

In 2022, I modelled the famous Jedi Council Chamber featured in a well-known film franchise.
At this time I used SketchUp to develop a 3D model of the space, and ray tracing via Odeon to generate an impulse response.

You can read the original report here: [Report on the Auralisation and Analysis of the Jedi Chamber](Report_Auralisation_of_the_Jedi_Chamber.pdf)

Im this project, I will be investigating other methods and tools which may be used to model the very same room with the aim to familiarise myself with these tools and learn their strengths and weaknesses.
